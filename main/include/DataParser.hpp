/**
 * @file DataParser.hpp
 * @brief Declaration of the DataParser class for parsing and executing commands.
 * 
 * The DataParser class is responsible for analyzing incoming messages,
 * detecting known commands prefixed by "CMD", executing them through the
 * CommandHandler interface, or forwarding them appropriately to another system.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - Construct with a reference to a CommandHandler instance.
 * - Call `parse()` to extract and identify commands.
 * - Use `executeCommand()` to handle valid commands.
 * - Run `dataParserTask()` inside a FreeRTOS task to continuously process messages.
 * 
 * Command structure:
 * - Recognized commands: prefixed with "CMD", e.g., "CMD CHIP_INFO"
 * - Forwarding: "CMD OTHER <command>" is forwarded as "CMD <command>"
 * 
 * @note Designed for use with ESP-IDF and FreeRTOS.
